  Abstract                 = {{Acoustic streaming motion in a compressible gas filled two-dimensional rectangular enclosure is simulated and the effects of the sound field intensity on the formation process of streaming structures are investigated numerically. The oscillatory flow field in the enclosure is created by the vibration of the left wall of the enclosure. The frequency of the wall vibration is chosen such that the lowest acoustic mode propagates along the enclosure. The fully compressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations is considered and an explicit time-marching algorithm is used to track the acoustic waves. The formation of the wave field in the enclosure is computed and fully described and the acoustic boundary layer development is predicted. The interaction of the wave field with viscous effects and the formation of streaming structures are revealed by time-averaging the solutions over a given period. The strength of the pressure waves associated with the acoustic effect and the resulting streaming flow pattern is found to be strongly correlated to the maximum displacement of the wall during a vibration cycle. The wave form determines the shape of the steady streaming structures in the oscillatory flow field. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America.}},

  Abstract                 = {Highly efficient washing and extraction of microbeads to decomplex analytes ranging from small peptides to large viruses was realised in a microscaled continuous flow format. The bead washing principle reported herein is based on acoustophoresis, i.e. the primary acoustic radiation force in an ultrasonic standing wave and laminar flow properties are utilised to translate bioanalytes trapped on functionalised microbeads from one carrier fluid to another. The carry-over of non-specific material ranges from 1 to 50 ppm relative to input levels depending on application, making acoustophoresis suitable for extraction of rare species from complex environments. Selective extraction of a phosphopeptide relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart is demonstrated using metal oxide affinity capture {(MOAC)} beads and {MALDI-TOF} {MS} readout. Acoustophoresis of microbeads activated with specific binders could be used to capture phage viral particles. The efficiency of the acoustophoretic washing principle was demonstrated by an unspecific phage cross contamination level of only 10(-6) of that in the input bead/phage mixture. The continuous flow format makes acoustophoretic washing flexible regarding sample volume and also allows for easy integration into a sequence of particle handling and analytical unit operations.},

  Abstract                 = {A General Defocusing Particle Tracking (GDPT) method is proposed for tracking the three-dimensional motion of particles in Lab-on-a-chip systems based on a set of calibration images and the normalized cross-correlation function. In comparison with other single-camera defocusing particle-tracking techniques{,} GDPT possesses a series of key advantages: it is applicable to particle images of arbitrary shapes{,} it is intuitive and easy to use{,} it can be used without advanced knowledge of optics and velocimetry theory{,} it is robust against outliers and overlapping particle images{,} and it requires only equipment which is standard in microfluidic laboratories. We demonstrate the method by tracking the three-dimensional motion of 2 [small mu ]m spherical particles in a microfluidic channel using three different optical arrangements. The position of the particles was measured with an estimated uncertainty of 0.1 [small mu ]m in the in-plane direction and 2 [small mu ]m in the depth direction for a measurement volume of 1510 [times] 1270 [times] 160 [small mu ]m3. A ready-to-use GUI implementation of the method can be acquired on http://www.unibw.de/lrt7/gdpt.},

  Abstract                 = {A mean force exerted on a small rigid sphere by a sound wave in a viscous fluid is calculated. The force is expressed as a sum of drag force coming from the external steady flow existing in the absence of the sphere and contributions that are cross products of velocity and velocity derivatives of the incident field. Because of the drag force and an acoustic streaming generated near the sphere, the mean force does not coincide with the acoustic radiation pressure, i.e., the mean momentum flux carried by the sound field through any surface enclosing the sphere. If the sphere radius R is considerably smaller than the viscous wave penetration depth delta, the drag force can give the leading-order contribution (in powers of delta/R) to the mean force and the latter can then be directed against the radiation pressure. In another limit, delta much less than R, the drag force and acoustic streaming play a minor role, and the mean force reduces to the radiation pressure, which can be expressed through source strengths of the scattered sound field. The effect of viscosity can then be significant only if the incident wave is locally plane traveling. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America. {[}S0001-4966(99)05512-5].},

  Abstract                 = {The recent introduction of surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology onto lab-on-a-chip platforms has opened a new frontier in microfluidics. The advantages provided by such SAW microfluidics are numerous: simple fabrication, high biocompatibility, fast fluid actuation, versatility, compact and inexpensive devices and accessories, contact-free particle manipulation, and compatibility with other microfluidic components. We believe that these advantages enable SAW microfluidics to play a significant role in a variety of applications in biology, chemistry, engineering and medicine. In this review article, we discuss the theory underpinning SAWs and their interactions with particles and the contacting fluids in which they are suspended. We then review the SAW-enabled microfluidic devices demonstrated to date, starting with devices that accomplish fluid mixing and transport through the use of travelling SAW; we follow that by reviewing the more recent innovations achieved with standing SAW that enable such actions as particle/cell focusing, sorting and patterning. Finally, we look forward and appraise where the discipline of SAW microfluidics could go next.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate the measurement of mass, density, and size of cells and nanoparticles using suspended microchannel resonators. The masses of individual particles are quantified as transient frequency shifts, while the particles transit a microfluidic channel embedded in the resonating cantilever. Mass histograms resulting from these data reveal the distribution of a population of heterogeneously sized particles. Particle density is inferred from measurements made in different carrier fluids since the frequency shift for a particle is proportional to the mass difference relative to the displaced solution. We have characterized the density of polystyrene particles, Escherichia coli, and human red blood cells with a resolution down to 10(-4) g/cm(3). (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

The cells form into bands at half wavelength intervals in the blood vessels. This phenomenon is described, and the forces that may be involved are discussed. The forces considered include standing wave radiation pressure, inter-cellular forces and Oseen forces. A computer model is described and the computed trajectories of cells under the action of these forces are shown.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {Non-contact trapping using acoustic standing waves has shown promising results in cell-based research lately. However, the devices demonstrated are normally fabricated using microfabrication or precision machining methods leading to a high unit cost. In e. g. clinical or forensic applications avoiding cross-contamination, carryover or infection is of outmost importance. In these applications disposable devices are key elements, thus making the cost per unit a critical factor. A solution is presented here where low-cost off-the-shelf glass capillaries are used as resonators for standing wave trapping. Single-mode as well as multi-node trapping is demonstrated with an excellent agreement between simulated and experimentally found operation frequencies. Single particle trapping is verified at 7.53 MHz with a trapping force on a 10 mm particle of up to 1.27 nN. The non-contact trapping is proved using confocal microscopy. Finally, an application is presented where the capillary is used as a pipette for aspirating, trapping and dispensing red blood cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Acoustic trapping of submicron particles can allow enrichment and purification of small-sized and low-abundant microorganisms. In this paper, we investigate the dependency of the ability to capture submicron particles on the particle concentration. Based on the findings, it is demonstrated that seed particles can be introduced, in acoustic trapping, to enable capture of low abundant submicron particles. Without using seed particles, continuous enrichment of 490 nm polystyrene particles is demonstrated in a rectangular capillary with a locally generated acoustic field at high particle concentrations, i.e. above 1 %wt. Trapping of submicron particles at significantly lower concentrations was subsequently accomplished by seeding 10-12 micrometer-sized particles in the acoustic trap prior to the submicron particle capture. Further, the new seed particle aided acoustic trapping technique was employed for the continuous enrichment of bacteria (E. coli) with a capture efficiency of 95 %. Finally, seed particle assisted acoustic trapping and enrichment is demonstrated for polymer-based particles down to 110 nm in diameter.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite its fundamental role in the dynamics of compressible fluids, bulk viscosity has received little experimental attention and there remains a paucity of measured data. Acoustic spectroscopy provides a robust and accurate approach to measuring this parameter. Working from the Navier-Stokes model of a compressible fluid one can show that the bulk viscosity makes a significant and measurable contribution to the frequency-squared acoustic attenuation. Here we employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over a temperature range of 7 to 50C. The measured attenuation spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk viscosity of water is found to be approximately three times larger than its shear counterpart, reinforcing its significance in acoustic propagation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that this technique can be readily and generally applied to fluids to accurately determine their temperature dependent bulk viscosities.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a technique based on pulsed ultrasounds for controlling, reducing to a minimum observable value the acoustic streaming in closed ultrasonic standing wave fluidic resonators. By modifying the number of pulses and the repetition time it is possible to reduce the velocity of the acoustic streaming with respect to the velocity generated by the continuous ultrasound mode of operation. The acoustic streaming is observed at the nodal plane where a suspension of 800nm latex particles was focused by primary radiation force. A mixture of 800nm and 15$\mu$m latex particles has been also used for showing that the acoustic streaming is hardly reduced while primary and secondary forces continue to operate. The parameter we call "pulse mode factor" i.e. the time of applied ultrasound divided by the duty cycle, is found to be the adequate parameter that controls the acoustic streaming. We demonstrate that pulsed ultrasound is more efficient for controlling the acoustic streaming than the variation of the amplitude of the standing waves.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology to fractionate suspended particles according to size and/or acoustic properties is reported. This fractionation is accomplished by simultaneously subjecting the particles to a resonant acoustic field and a laminar flow field propagating in an orthogonal direction. The acoustic field induces a redistribution of the particles within the cross-section of a narrow separator channel while the laminar flow transports the particles along the separator channel towards the exit. By altering the strength of the flow relative to the strength of the acoustic field, the desired fractionation can be controlled. Proof-of-principle experiments conducted with binary mixtures of polystyrene particles are reported. The performance of the experimental device was analyzed using a model based on calculations of the trajectory of particles through the chamber. The acoustic method has potential to rapidly and selectively factionate suspended solids with very low specific power consumption.},

  Abstract                 = {A fractionation method applicable to different populations of cells in a suspension is reported. The separation was accomplished by subjecting the suspension to a resonant ultrasonic field and a laminar flow field propagating in orthogonal directions within a thin, rectangular chamber. Steady, laminar flow transports the cell suspension along the chamber, while the ultrasonic field causes the suspended cells to migrate to the mid-plane of the chamber at rates related to their size and physical properties. A thin flow splitter positioned near the outlet divides the effluent cell suspension into two product streams, thereby allowing cells that respond faster to the acoustic field to be separated from those cells that respond more slowly. Modeling of the trajectories of individual cells through the chamber shows that by altering the strength of the flow relative to that of the acoustic field, the desired fractionation can be controlled. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed using hybridoma cells and Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells. The two populations of cells could be effectively separated using this technique, resulting in hybridoma/Lactobacillus ratios in the left and right product streams, normalized to the feed ratio, of 6.9+/-1.8 and 0.39+/-0.01 (vol/vol), respectively. The acoustic method is fast, efficient, and could be operated continuously with a high degree of selectivity and yield and with low power consumption. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The particles were delivered to the reflector's surface by acoustically induced flow. The capture dependencies on suspension concentration, duration of experiments and acoustic pressure have been established at 1.09, 1.46 and 1.75 MHz. Five-fold capture increase has been obtained at 1.75 MHz in comparison to the control (no ultrasound) situation. The contrasting behaviours of 1, 0.5 and 0.2 mum fluorescent latex beads in a lambda/4 USW resonator at 1.46 MHz have been characterized. The particle movements were observed with an epi-fluorescent microscope and the velocities of the particles were measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiments showed that whereas the trajectories of 1 mum particles were mainly affected by the direct radiation force, 0.5 mum particles were influenced both by the radiation force and acoustic streaming. The 0.2 mum latex beads followed acoustic streaming in the chamber and were not detectably affected by the radiation force. The streaming-associated behaviour of the 200 nm particles has implications for enhanced immunocapture of viruses and macromolecules (both of which are also too small to experience significant acoustic radiation force).},

  Abstract                 = {{The progress in microfabrication and lab-on-a-chip technologies has been a major area of development for new approaches to bioanalytics and integrated concepts for cell biology. Fundamental advances in the development of elastomer based microfluidics have been driving factors for making microfluidic technology available to a larger scientific community in the past years. In line with this, microfluidic separation of cells and particles is currently developing rapidly where key areas of interest are found in designing lab-on-a-chip systems that offer controlled microenvironments for studies of fundamental cell biology. More recently industrial interests are seen in the development of micro chip based flow cytometry technology both for preclinical research and clinical diagnostics. This critical review outlines the most recent developments in microfluidic technology for cell and particle separation in continuous flow based systems. (130 references)}},

We assume spherical symmetry and a coupling of the bubble oscillations. Our results show that the strength and even the directions of the resulting secondary Bjerknes forces differ considerably from predictions of the well-known linear theory. This is of immediate consequence for understanding and modeling structure formation professes in acoustic cavitation and multi-bubble sonoluminescence.},

  Abstract                 = {{As originally realized by Nyborg (J. Acoust. Soc. Am., vol. 30, 1958, P. 329), the problem of the inner acoustic/steady streaming can be analysed in quite general terms. The inner streaming is the one that develops in the high-frequency limit in a thin Stokes (shear-wave) layer at a boundary, in contrast to the outer streaming in the main bulk of the fluid. The analysis provides relevant inner-streaming characteristics through a given distribution of the acoustic amplitude along the boundary. Here such a generalized treatment is revisited for a motionless boundary. By working in terms of surface vectors, though in elementary notations, new compact and easy-to-use expressions are obtained. The most important ones are those for the effective (apparent) slip velocity at the boundary as seen from a perspective of the main bulk of the fluid, which is often the sole driving factor behind the outer streaming, and for the induced (acoustic) steady tangential stress on the boundary. As another novel development, non-adiabatic effects in the Stokes layer are taken into account, which become apparent through the fluctuating density and viscosity perturbations, and whose contribution into the streaming is often ignored in the literature. Some important particular cases, such as the axisymmetric case and the incompressible case, are emphasized. As far as the application of the derived general inner-streaming expressions is concerned, a few examples provided here involve a plane acoustic standing wave, which either grazes a wall parallel to its direction (convenient for the estimation of the non-adiabatic effects), or into which a small (compared to the acoustic wavelength) rigid sphere is placed. If there are simultaneously two such waves, out-of-phase and, say, in mutually orthogonal directions, a disk placed coplanarly with them will undergo a steady torque, which is calculated here as another example. Two further examples deal with translational high-frequency harmonic vibrations of particles relative to an incompressible fluid medium, viz, of a rigid oblate spheroid (along its axis) and of a sphere (arbitrary three dimensional). The latter can be a fixed rigid sphere, one free to rotate or even a (viscous) spherical drop, for which the outer streaming and the internal circulation are also considered.}},
